I.I   CONTINUOUS COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION<p>

School is an institution where talents are nurtured , therefore it becomes very important to continuously revise & introduce such measures & 
scheme which will have impact on the mind, character & physical ability of a learner. keeping this in mind the Ministry of Human Resource 
Development has introduced CCE i.e. , Continuous & Comprehenshiv Evaluation in the schools across the country with the aim of developing
the holistic profile of the learner through CCE. The earlier over emphasis on cognitive domain has been replaced with a more"holistic learning
plan" providing for development of affective & psychomotor domains of the learner's personality such as human values, attitudes, life skills, 
physical & mental health.</b>
