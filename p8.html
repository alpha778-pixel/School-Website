In this day and age, where every day security is becoming the biggest concern among citizens, parents are increasingly concerned  about the
accountability of their children when they leave home for school and till the time they return home. At the same time with today's social and
 political problems, schools and parents are required to take definite steps to tackle the additional responsibility of ensuring the safety to 
their children while they are at school care. That is to say , from the time they leave home for school either on a school bus or on their own till the 
time they reach home. Now, while it's not the school's responsibility to moniter the movement of a child once he or she leaves school on their
own or when they leave their homes for school(for non school bus children) but the schol can take steps to alert parents, if things are out of
the ordinary in the arrival and departure patterns of the children from school.<p><br>

With the influence of the media, opulent lifestyles, increasingly busy parents and worst of all sheer peer pressure, the best of and the most 
disciplined of children are coerced/influenced into missing school, resulting in the parents believing their children are at school, when actually
their whereabouts are unaccountable.<p><br>

Realizing the growing need for a solution to these issues several up market schools in India have opted to implement the ReTSER solution, a state 
of the art monitoring and security system designed especially considering India conditions and customized specifically for our school.<p><br>

Needless to say this does not absolve the parents of their continued duty and responsibility of being diligent parents and teaching their children
to be responsible human beings.</h2>
